                    14 de Septiembre is a 3d horror game where <b>you are chased and harassed by an entity</b>, you are a child who must prepare for school and must prepare by making a small 
                    basement visit. <b>The game was developed in 7 days</b> and was the first jam we worked on 3D using Godot 4. Undoubtedly the most complicated, <b>the game features chases and numerous
                    spooks</b>, due to the time available to complete the game some were shortened as well as some of the game's 3D assets. It end up being a good short horror game lasting 15 to 20 minutes.
                   </p> 
                   <p>  My work that week was consumed organizing the codes that carried the random chases of the basement and the correct operation of the scares, especially the mirror
                    which used a </b>small shader and a camera to simulate the reflection<b>. The biggest problem was the mistakes that Godot constantly made about the models, in a second they looked and worked perfect,
                    the next they were corrupted, even though they had a proper format. </b>Even with all the setbacks we managed to have a product that more than one has given a good "heart shock".<b>
                   </p>
                    <p>The </b>Free Game Planet<b> page made us a small article and </b>you can find numerous gameplays on YouTube.<b>
