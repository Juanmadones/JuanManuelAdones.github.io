                    During the whole development, until the last day, we thought we didn’t get to finish it. It was a big lesson that was suffered in this jam, but
                    this was not just any jam. <b>The Indie Spain Jam takes place 1 time a year and brings together the best developers in Spain to create something unique 
                    in a week, a lot of prizes are waiting for the winners and competitiveness was sky high.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Approaching Quiet, (referred to as TAQ from now on) is a <b>strategic resource management game where you are chased by a mysterious fog
                    that is swallowing the planet</b>, to win in TAQ the player must reach one of the rockets that will leave the planet, on the way you will find other survivors
                    and situations that can put you in danger. The combat in this game follows the structure of stone, paper or scissors where the skills of your characters and statistics
                    influence your chances of victory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>My job was to create the navigation map system, all TAQ events and organizing player data as the game progresses, the characters the player have and
                    his resources</b>. Also as in previous projects I implemented animations, SFX, VFX, music, illustrations and sprites. <b>Best of all is that it is the only game that is uploaded 
                    on Android and works great.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    How did it go? <b>TAQ was 8th in the general category and at the awards gala in Malaga we received an honorable mention</b>, everyone liked the game.
                    Doing it in a week was an achievement that I found impossible during development, with an unwavering constancy the challenge was overcome and we could enjoy
                    of the disbelief of the people who played it.
